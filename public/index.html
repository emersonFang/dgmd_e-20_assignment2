										<p>Thank you for visiting Emerson Fang's music lesson page.  This page is dedicated to all lover's of music.  Music is in the silence between the notes.  It's a high art form.  Blah blah blah are three words that make sounds.  You can start learning to play music from a very young age.</p>

										<h3>Classical Music!</h3>

										<p class="ui-grid-c-image"><a href="assets/images/bach_facsimile.jpg"><img class="ui-block_image" src="assets/images/bach_facsimile.jpg" alt="Bach"></a></p>

										<p><a href="#" class="ui-btn">Learn more &gt;&gt;</a></p>

										<p>Classical music is a beautiful artform, and learning and performing it is an exciting and lifelong journey. Try to remember that sweet time in September, were birds chirping then? Birdsong is a beautiful form of nature's music.</p>

										<p>Feel free to take a look around! Here you will find information about the teacher, and a form for lesson inquiries.  The form has many fields to fill out, and you can tell me all about yourself and what you hope to achieve in lessons.</p>

										<p>Learning to play an instrument should be fun and relaxing, but takes  a good deal of concentration.  I recommend practicing for 30 minutes to an hour at a time, and then taking a 15 minute break if you want to do a marathon run of practicing for several hours in the day.  It's probably unhealthy to practice 8 hours straight through.</p>

									</div>

										<h3>Practicing</h3>

										<p class="ui-grid-c-image"><a href="assets/images/orchestra.jpg"><img class="ui-block_image" src="assets/images/orchestra.jpg" alt="Orchestra"></a></p>

										<p><a href="#" data-role="button">Learn more &gt;&gt;</a></p>

										<p>Slow practice is great for getting your brain to comprehend what needs to be done physically to produce the best sound.  Even though it might be boring, it helps train you focus and strategize for the best physical execution of how to perform something.  Once you have played something 10 times in a row perfectly at a certain speed, increase the tempo by turning up your metronome.</p>

										<p>Rhythms are also great for learning how to play fast runs on an instrument.  Dotted rhytms, such as sixteenth note plus a dotted eighth, or vice versa, are a good starting point.  Next you can go on to playing triplets to increase the speed of the run.  Repeating this method is a good way to train yourself to do something well.  It can be a fun exercise.</p>

										<p>Always start playing scales slowly and listen to the relationship between the notes slowly and carefully.  That way you can train your ear to hear the interval between the notes better and improve your intonation.   On the violin, certain notes might cause the violin to resonate more if they are played in tune, such as a note that corresponds to an open string, or any of the fifths or thirds correspond to the open strings.</p>

										<h3>Randomness!</h3>

										<p><a href="#" data-role="button" data-icon="gear" data-theme="b">Get creative &gt;&gt;</a></p>

										<p>I don't understand how wind players have such great breath control.  Having asthma makes it more difficult.  Perhaps playing a wind instrument helps improve lung capacity and strengthens the diaphragm, so that you the asthma is not as much of an issue.  Who knows.  Ask your doctor for more information, since I'm not a medical professional.  Woohoo!</p>

										<p>This is random text, I'm just typing a stream of consciousness sentence again because apparently we cannot use lorem ipsum and that is sad.  So I guess I will try to add an emphasis tag around <em>BRAVO!</em> here and then select it in the style sheet and make it <strong>PRETTY</strong></p>

										<p>These are some of my favorite pieces - Brahms Symphony No. 2, Also Spracht Zarathustra, Songs My Mother Taught Me, Beethoven's Appasionata, Clair De Lune, Faure's Pavane, and Miley Cyrus' Wrecking Ball.  Just kidding about the last one.  It is kind of catchy though, so no big deal.  Pop music is okay, but just not as complicated.</p>

										<p>Hurray this is the second to last paragraph.  Did you know that <abbr title="New York State Summer School of the Arts">NYSSSA</abbr> stands for "New York State Summer School of the Arts"? It was a pretty good program back when I was in it.  There was a great conductor who would say the darndest things during rehearsal.  He was a funny guy, and everyone loved talking to him.  Make it sound like a soufflé- you know, just the right temperature, like a good pizza.</p>

										<p>It’s the old Vienna, before Hitler and all that idiotic, stupid crowd.  If you can’t play loud, at least look loud.  I knew Yo-Yo Ma before he <i>was</i> Yo-Yo Ma.  A sudden fauk. Do you know what a fauk is? A sudden storm. I said fauk.  What <b>was</b> that? God, you can get some ugly sounds and some heavenly sounds on that thing. You’ve got quite a Pandora’s Box there.</p>
