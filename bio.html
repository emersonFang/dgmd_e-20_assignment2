  			<h4>Violin Awesomeness</h4>
			<blockquote cite="">
			"The Violin is awesome.  Everything is awesome! I'm so happy to be playing piano too.  Man, life is so awesome.  Awesome socks.  Black socks never get dirty, the longer you wear the stronger they get.  Sometimes I think should wash them but something keeps telling me don't wash them yet.  Not yet, not yet, not yet.  This is a blockquote, within an aside element."<br><br>
